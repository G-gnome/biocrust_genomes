Mon Feb 12 13:16:20 2024 : Preparing HMM database (should be quick)...
Mon Feb 12 13:16:20 2024 : Checking and handling input sequence data (should not take long)...
Mon Feb 12 13:16:21 2024 : Comparing sequences to HMM database (round 1 of 1)...
    Mon Feb 12 13:16:21 2024 : Fungi analysis of main strand finished.
    Mon Feb 12 13:16:22 2024 : Fungi analysis of complementary strand finished.
Mon Feb 12 13:16:22 2024 : Analysing results of HMM-scan (this might take quite some time)...
Mon Feb 12 13:16:22 2024 : Extraction finished!
